Enhancement: Apply (1) to uploads' name conflicts

When new files were uploaded manually to pC, shared from a 3rd party app or text shared with oC
name conflict happens, (2) was added to the file name instead of (1).

Right now if we upload a file with a repeated name, the new file name will end with (1).
